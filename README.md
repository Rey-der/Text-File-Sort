🗂️ Text-File-Sort App  
  
Electron App that saves clipboard data, saves files, and sorts them in a unique way  
⚠️ Important Security Warning  
  
This application handles clipboard data, file storage, and text sorting. While functional, it currently lacks comprehensive security measures, which may expose users to potential risks, including:  

🔹 Unfiltered Clipboard Input → Data captured from the clipboard is not sanitized, creating potential vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS attacks).  
🔹 File Access Risks → The app interacts with local file storage but does not fully validate file paths or permissions, which could lead to unintended access issues.  
🔹 InnerHTML Usage → The application may use innerHTML in some cases, increasing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if malicious input is processed.  
🔹 IPC Communication Security → Electron’s IPC mechanisms (ipcMain.on) must be carefully implemented to prevent unauthorized access or data exposure.  
📌 Overview

The Text-File-Sort App is an Electron-based desktop application designed to:  
✅ Capture selected text (e.g., from the clipboard)  
✅ Store it locally  
✅ Organize it in a unique way  

With a responsive UI divided into different tabs, the app offers:  
  
    📝 Text Capture: Capture and edit text in its own tab.  
    📂 Folder Management: Organize saved files into folders, search for specific   folders, and sort them in various ways.  
    🧠 Mindmap Integration: Visually organize your saved data through an   interactive mindmap with drag-and-drop functionality.  

⚙️ Features  
  
✅ Clipboard/Text Capture – Capture selected text via a browser extension or copy-paste.  
✅ Local Storage – Save the captured data in files or databases (e.g., JSON, SQLite, IndexedDB).  
✅ Unique Sorting – Manage your files using a flexible folder system with sorting options.  
✅ Mindmap Visualization – Arrange your data visually in a mindmap with interactive controls.  
✅ Responsive Design – The UI dynamically adjusts to different window sizes.  
✅ In-App Reload – A dedicated button allows you to restart the app without   reopening the terminal.
